Bid Blitzkrieg
=========

Bid Blitzkrieg is a powerful and feature-rich online auction platform built with Flask, a high-level Python web framework. It provides a seamless and engaging experience for sellers to list their products, buyers to bid competitively, and administrators to manage the entire auction process efficiently.

Key Features
------------

-   User Authentication and Authorization: Secure registration and login system for admins, sellers, and buyers with role-based access control.
-   Admin Management: Admins can add/remove other admins, manage sellers, buyers, and products, generate reports on ongoing auctions and auction results.
-   Seller Functionality: Sellers can easily list products for auction, create new auctions (subject to admin approval), and track bids on their listed items.
-   Buyer Functionality: Buyers can browse products up for bidding, place manual or automatic bids, and leave reviews for sellers after winning.
-   Auction Management: Auctions have defined start/end times, support minimum bid requirements, and automatic closure upon reaching the end time.
-   Bidding System: Real-time bidding with bid amount validation, highest bid tracking, and automatic bid closing after inactivity.
-   Product Management: Sellers can add products with multiple images, descriptions, and minimum bids. Admins can edit or remove products.
-   Notifications: Winners and losers receive email notifications after an auction concludes.
-   Billing Integration (Optional): Buyers can initiate digital check payments to sellers using a third-party billing API.
