# Bid Blitzkrieg - Online Auction Platform

## Overview

Bid Blitzkrieg is a feature-rich online auction platform built with Flask, designed to provide a seamless bidding experience for buyers and sellers. The platform supports role-based user management, real-time bidding, auction management, and comprehensive admin controls. Users can register as buyers or sellers, with sellers able to create and manage auctions while buyers can browse and bid on items. The system includes automated auction lifecycle management, email notifications, and a responsive web interface.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
- **Flask with SQLAlchemy**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in building web applications. Flask provides a lightweight foundation while SQLAlchemy offers robust ORM capabilities for database operations.
- **Blueprint Architecture**: The application uses a modular approach with separate route handlers, forms, and models to maintain code organization and scalability.

### Database Design
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL Support**: The application is configured to work with SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production environments through environment variable configuration.
- **User Role System**: Implements a three-tier role system (admin, seller, buyer) with appropriate permission controls and access restrictions.
- **Auction Lifecycle Management**: Database schema supports complete auction workflows from creation to completion, including status tracking and bidding history.

### Authentication & Security
- **Flask-Login Integration**: Provides session management and user authentication with role-based access control.
- **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF CSRF protection enabled across all forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Password Security**: Uses Werkzeug's password hashing utilities for secure password storage and verification.

### File Management
- **Image Upload System**: Handles product images with file validation, secure filename generation, and organized storage in static directories.
- **File Size Limits**: Implements 16MB maximum file size restriction with proper error handling.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Uses Bootstrap for responsive design and consistent UI components across the platform.
- **Real-time Features**: JavaScript-based countdown timers and auto-refresh functionality for active auctions.
- **Template Inheritance**: Jinja2 template system with base template inheritance for consistent layout and navigation.

### Email Notifications
- **Flask-Mail Integration**: Configured with Gmail SMTP for sending auction-related notifications to users.
- **Automated Messaging**: System sends notifications for auction outcomes, bid confirmations, and status updates.

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web application framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and connection management
- **Flask-Login**: User session and authentication management
- **Flask-WTF**: Form handling and CSRF protection
- **Flask-Mail**: Email notification system

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap CSS Framework**: Responsive UI components and styling
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced visual elements
- **Custom CSS/JavaScript**: Additional styling and interactive features

### Database Systems
- **SQLite**: Development database (default)
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database support through environment configuration

### Email Service
- **Gmail SMTP**: Email delivery service for notifications and user communications

### File Storage
- **Local File System**: Static file storage for uploaded auction images with organized directory structure

## Database Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Default Database**: SQLite (automatically configured)
- **Database File**: `auction.db` (created automatically in project root)
- **No Setup Required**: SQLite database is created automatically when the application starts

### Production Environment
The application supports PostgreSQL for production deployments. Configure the following environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
```

### Database Schema
The application automatically creates the following tables:
- `user`: User accounts with role-based access (admin, seller, buyer)
- `auction`: Auction listings with status tracking and timing
- `bid`: Bidding history and current bid tracking
- `category`: Product categories for auction organization

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.11+** installed on your system
2. **PostgreSQL database** (for production deployment)
3. **Gmail account** (for email notifications)

### Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables for production:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name

# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Email Configuration (Optional)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### Deployment Process

#### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Database Setup**: Create a PostgreSQL database in Replit
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure secrets in Replit settings:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (provided automatically by Replit PostgreSQL)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (generate a secure random string)
   - Email settings (if notifications are needed)
3. **Deploy**: Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
4. **Admin Account**: Access `/admin/init` to create the initial admin user

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bid-blitzkrieg
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name"
   export SESSION_SECRET="your-secure-secret-key"
   ```

4. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from app import app, db; app.app_context().push(); db.create_all()"
   ```

5. **Create Admin User**:
   - Start the application: `python main.py`
   - Navigate to `/admin/init` to create the initial admin account

6. **Start Production Server**:
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
   ```

### Post-Deployment Setup

#### 1. Admin Account Creation
- Visit `yourdomain.com/admin/init`
- Create the first admin user account
- This route is automatically disabled after the first admin is created

#### 2. Demo Data (Optional)
The application includes demo categories and can be populated with sample auctions for testing.

#### 3. Email Configuration Testing
- Test email functionality by creating an auction and checking notifications
- Verify SMTP settings are correct if emails are not being sent

### Production Considerations

#### Security
- Use strong, unique `SESSION_SECRET`
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Regular database backups
- Monitor for security updates

#### Performance
- Configure database connection pooling for high traffic
- Set up static file serving through a CDN
- Monitor application performance and database queries

#### Maintenance
- Regular database backups
- Monitor disk space for image uploads
- Keep dependencies updated for security patches

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Errors**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials
2. **Image Upload Failures**: Check write permissions for `static/uploads` directory
3. **Email Not Sending**: Verify Gmail app password and SMTP settings
4. **500 Errors**: Check application logs for detailed error messages

#### Demo Credentials
For testing purposes, a demo admin account can be created:
- Email: `admin@auction.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Role: Admin

**Note**: Change these credentials immediately in production environments.
